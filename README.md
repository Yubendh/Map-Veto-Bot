Fork of my friend Wathana's Veto bot to fix issues with bot


instructions to run bot
please this this in the terminal first : npm install discord.js @discordjs/rest dotenv

in case you don't have nodejs please
Install nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en
after you finish the step above please edit the .env file and then run command.js first.
It gonna show a message in the terminal said it "Successfully reloaded application (/) commands"
